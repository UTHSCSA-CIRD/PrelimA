            xvarHelp="Any one of the categorical variables in your data (aka factors) is eligible to be the predictor variable. This version of Survomatic <i>does</i> support more than two factor levels, but the hypotheses it tests currently are as yet limited to whether or not each parameter is the same across all the groups. If in doubt, it is suggested that you organize your data in such a way that pairwise comparisons are being made.",
            cvarHelp="You must have a column of censoring indicators set to 0 if observation of the subject stopped for ANY reason other than the event of interest ocurring (including the study period elapsing) and 1 if it was a normal, non-censored event. The response variable should be either the time the event occurred or the time at which that subject was censored. An example of censored events would be animals dying due to fighting or malocclusion (unless you are studying fighting or malocclusion). To be absolutely clear: if you do not keep track of censored events, you are distorting your results. In the unlikely event that you really have no censored events, you could edit your file so there exists a column of 1's and then resubmit it.",
            yvarHelp="This is time elapsed from the start of observation to death, in days. Only use age since birth if deaths started being recorded from the day the animals were born. Only use age since wean if deaths started being recorded from the day the animals were weaned.",
            smresHelp="<b>Model.Search</b>: Survomatic starts by fitting a (joint) Gompertz model and then iteratively considers nesting models: Gompertz vs Gompertz-Makeham and Gompertz vs Logistic, and then Gompertz-Makeham vs Logistic-Makeham and Logistic vs Logistic-Makeham. This section shows what models were considered, and whether or not they were superior to the 'g' model. The currently supported models are: 'g','gm','l', and 'lm'. <br/> <b>Fits</b>: Here are the unconstrained parameter estimates for each of the models considered, and accompanying standard errors. There is a bug in the evaluation of the information matrix that sometimes causes SE estimation to fail. For the time being, an NA value is reported for such cases. NAs are also filled in for parameters a given model does not have. <br/><b>Hypothesis.Tests</b>: P-values for the likelihood ratio test on the hypothesis of no difference between any of the groups for each of the model parameters in turn, followed by the omnibus test of the hypothesis that ALL parameters are the same between all the groups. At this time, the webapp only tests hypotheses about the model most justified by the Model.Search step. <br/><b>LL.and.AIC</b> The log-likelihood (LL), degrees of freedom (DF), and Akaike information criterion (AIC) for each model and group considered. The final three columns are the joint LL, DF, and AIC.");
