            yvarHelp = "This is the quantity you are measuring, sometimes called the dependent variable. If the variable you were expecting is not showing up in this list it may mean at least one value was in a non-numeric format, or that there are too few distinct values relative to the sample size. If the former case, please proof-read your data and try again. In the latter case, it's beyond the scope of this app and you might want to tell your statistician the code-word 'discrete response variable'. Or, maybe the sample size is simply too small for meaningful analysis.",
            cvarHelp = "If you have survival/time-to-event data, you must have a column of censoring indicators set to 0 if observation of the subject stopped for ANY reason other than the event of interest ocurring (including the study period elapsing) and 1 if it was a normal, non-censored event. The response variable should be either the time the even occurred or the time at which that subject was censored. Examples of censored events would be animals dying to fighting or malocclusion (unless you are studying fighting or malocclusion) or animals that spend the maximum amount of time on the rotarod without falling off. To be absolutely clear: if you do not keep track of censored events, you are distorting your results. The censoring column is how you tell this app to use a time-to-event model instead of a linear model.",
            gvarHelp = "Are your data grouped in some way? One example is when each subject is measured at multiple times or under multiple conditions (group by subject ID). Another example is when you do identical replicates of the same experiment on different days (group by day). Yet another example is when your samples are randomized across several gels or plates because there are too many to fit on just one (group by gel or plate). Basically, any non-biological grouping of samples that would be different if the whole study was redone somewhere else. Choosing a grouping variable tells this app to use a mixed-effect linear model instead of the default fixed-effect one. Also, if the reason your data are grouped is because they represent longitudinal measurements over time in the same subjects, AND it looks like the response peaks at a certain time and then goes down, that is also beyond the scope of this app and is an important issue to discuss with your statistician. Use the code-word 'time series with non-monotonic, non-linear response'.",
            gvarmultiHelp = "It is possible to have multiple levels of grouping (e.g. repeated measures on each mouse, and the mice themselves are grouped into litters or batches). That is currently beyond the scope of this app. If you have a complex grouping structure in your data, check this box to remind your statistician to address this issue.",
            xvarHelp = "These are the 'ordinary' variables. Do not include variables you know to be redundant (i.e. because you created one from the other). A ratio or other function of two variables is only redundant if you include both of the variables that comprise it, but not if you include just one. Other candidates for prior removal are things the app mistook for data, like dates or comments. But there can be a fine line between that and grouping variables (above). If there is a biological or technical reason why a variable could influence the response you should probably include it whether or not you think it is significant. If you aren't sure whether or not to remove a variable, ask your statistician. Code-word 'variable selection'. NOTE: currently, categoric variables with three or more possible values (e.g. WT/Het/Homozygous, none/low-dose/high-dose) cause crashes; so, while I'm fixing this problem, only categoric variables with exactly two possible values will show up in this menu.",
            rvarHelp = "The more equally represented all the other variables are within each group, the better protected your results are from confounding effects. Of course, that is not always possible-- a mouse will not change its sex part-way through and experiment, and even if you can change the treatment it receives that will create more problems than it solves unless you planned the experiment as a cross-over study to begin with. But, the variables that DO have more than one value within the same group show up here. The app then tries them all individually and in combination until it finds the ones that most need to be corrected for group-to-group variation. This will show up as the random slopes version of the model in your results. You should generally leave all the variables selected (the app will use only the ones that require it), but if you know that two of them are very closely related (for example, body weight and scaled body weight) then you should pick one to leave out, possibly the same one you leave out of the predictor variables below. If you don't know which ones to leave out, that's a question for your statistician, code-words 'variable selection' and 'multi-collinearity'. If there is a variable you expect to see on this menu but do not, either it's already taken by one of the above menu choices (which is fine) or for the grouping you chose there exist groups within which this variable does not change. Depending on how extreme this confounding effect is, it may or may not invalidate the analysis and the only way to make sure is to ask your statistician. Code-word 'confounding variable'.",
            tvarHelp = "Time-series data can have a property called 'autocorrelation', and if this is detected, appropriate adjustments must be made for the analysis to be valid. The app does not yet detect nor adjust for autocorrelation. However, you should still indicate a time-dependent variable if there is one so that you and your statistician will be reminded to address this issue later on. Only predictor variables show up on this list (i.e. not the Y variable, not even for survival data).",
            tvarmultiHelp = "You can have any number of time variables (e.g. days of age, which trial on that individual for that day, and then number of seconds since the start of that trial). However, at the moment this app can only handle one time variable. If you have more than one, use the one that you feel explains the most variation and then click this checkbox to remind you and your statistician that there do exist additional time variables.",
            svar_methodHelp = "If you have numeric variables then by default your model assumes that the reference response against which various effects will be compared will be the one that would be predicted if &lt;i&gt;all numeric variables in the model were set to zero&lt;/i&gt;! Sometimes this makes sense (e.g. zero days on diet, zero drug detected in urine) but usually it does not (body weight of zero? zero blood pressure?). In the latter case, the model may be less accurate (because it is projecting a value far outside the range covered by the data) and harder to interpret. To remedy this, you should choose a centering method (Median if you think the data are highly skewed or have large outliers, otherwise Mean) and then pick the numeric variables to center below. Now, the effects in your model will be relative to the mean or median values rather than relative to impossible zero values.",

If the screen goes black or if your data looks wrong on the 'Upload' tab, keep reloading the page and trying different combinations of 'Separator' and 'Quote character' until you find the one appropriate for your data.

If this assumption is true, you should be able to draw a straight horizontal line between the two dotted lines on each plot in the right-hand panel (there are usually several, you will have to scroll to see them all) without touching either dotted line. If this is true for all the plots, use the slider to pull  the blue lines as far apart as it allows. If there is one or more plots where this is not true, use the slider to pull the blue lines such that between them, the red line does stay within the dotted lines of the <i>worst</i> plot.

Your hypotheses (contrasts) are turned into a format the model understands (contrast matrices) and are included in the output on the Results tab. In addition to the hypotheses you choose (if any, they are optional), the Results will include any additional hypotheses that are implied by important interactions discovered during the model selection step if any such interactions are discovered. If these extra hypotheses are not relevant to your questions, you can simply ignore them. If all your variables are numeric, this menu will be empty. If your main experimental variable is categoric (e.g. 'genotype'), the rule of thumb is to pick the one hypothesis that compares the levels of that variable (e.g. 'WT vs Mutant') and let the algorithm find any others that might matter. If your main experimental variable is numeric (e.g. 'bodyweight'), the rule of thumb is to pick the one hypothesis that asks whether that variable influences the response in each group (e.g. 'body weight response in each group'). You should not test irrelevant hypotheses just because you can-- this will result in an overly complicated model and may under-estimate the significance of the real differences. Whether or not any hypotheses are selected by you or the algorithm, the default hypothesis tests will always be displayed in the Results table, with one p-value for each term in the final model (but these default hypotheses are not always meaningful, nor easy to interpret).",
            colTermHelp = "Each row represents a hypothesis test on your model. The intercept is the estimated response for the reference group (the group that has the control value for each variable). If a term has a variable name immediately followed by its level, it means the app thinks the variable is categorical (e.g. male/female, wildtype/mutant, control/treated). Such a term represents the DIFFERENCE in response between that level and the reference level (represented by the intercept). If a term has just the variable name, it means the app thinks the variable is numeric. Such a term represents the PER-UNIT CHANGE in response (e.g. change in rotarod time per gram of body weight, change in expression per microgram of drug) better known as slope. Some terms will contain more than one variable separated by ':'s. These are interaction terms. If at least one variable is categoric, you can interpret the term to mean the 'difference between the differences' (e.g. how differently do males and females respond to the treatment?). If both variables are numeric, you can interpret the term as how one numeric variable adjusts the per-unit effect of the other (e.g. how much is the change in rotarod time per gram of body weight affected by each additional day of age?).",
            colEffectHelp = "The Effect column is the same as the Beta column except if you specified a survival model by choosing a censoring indicator.

The ones that matter the most are the ones for your variable of interest and for interaction terms containing that variable (BOTH matter, see above). Generally if a variable is significant but does not interact with your main variable and doesn't interact with anything that interacts with your main main variable, you can mention in passing that it was significant, but its relevance to your hypothesis is limited to the fact that it independently influences the response and by including it in the model, you have already taken it into account. P-values for custom hypothesis tests (all the blocks in this table below the traditional hypothesis tests at the top, separated from each other by blank lines) are adjusted for multiple comparisons. The multiple comparison correction is not yet finished, so in this version of the app, the p-values are missing. Coming soon, believe me I understand you need this!",

There is also a grouping variable called 'batch' (perhaps the data were collected using identical methods but on three separate days). The variables 'id','date.of.birth','date.treatment.started', and 'date.measured' are not used directly in specifying a statistical model. However, it is a good idea to include some sort of individual identifier and birth/start/measure dates with four-digit years because this will make it easier to crosscheck, correct errors, and to investigate possible outliers. You can name your own columns anything you like and have as many as you need. Please note that if you also choose a censoring variable for your model, the grouping variable will be ignored and your data will be treated as if it's survival data (how much time elapses until an observation), *not* cross-sectional data (what is the value of Y at given values of the X variables)",

The grouping variable here is 'id'-- i.e. it groups together observations taken from the same individual over a period of time. This is the difference between a cross sectional dataset and a longitudinal dataset like this one (either one can have a grouping variable, but in a longitudinal dataset it represents individuals and has as many unique values as there were different individuals). Notice that each observation is on a separate line, and the values in the following columns repeat: 'id','date.of.birth','date.treatment.started','sex', and 'genotype'. This makes sense because for a given individual these variables remain constant. On the other hand, in these data the 'assay3', 'assay4', and of course 'date.measured' and 'age' values are different for each measurement. In this case the 'date.of.birth','date.treatment.started', and 'date.measured' are not directly used in specifying a statistical model.

            examplesvHelp = "In this example, the response (Y) variable is 'death.age.days' and the censoring variable is 'censored'. To be treated as survival data, the spreadsheet must include a column representing censored observations, and this column must only contain 0s and 1s (0 = censored, 1 = normal death). The categorical predictor (X) variables are 'sex' and 'genotype' and there is also a numeric predictor (X) variable, 'assay5'. The 'id' is a unique identifier for individual subjects. Though 'id','birth', and 'death' are not directly used for specifying a statisticl model, it is a good idea to include some sort of individual identifier and birth/death dates with four-digit years because this will make it easier to crosscheck, correct errors and investigate outliers. For censored events, the response variable should be the last age at which it is known for certain that an event had not yet occurred (for example, the last age at which that individual was seen alive). If your experiment involves an intervention that was started some period of time after birth, you should calculate the ages as date of death minus the date the intervention started, *not* the date of death minus date of birth. Also, survival data is not just for survival! It's for any experiment where you are measuring time elapsed until some event is observed and there is the possibility that this event will never be observed (e.g. because some other event happens first, such as accidental death). By this criterion, rotarod is a survival experiment, for example. There can be grouping variables in survival data, but at the moment this app ignores them with a warning. Your statistician should be able to incorporate them into the model. Code-words: 'Anderson-Gill', 'Frailty Term'"
